# Resource pack
We decided to make librepack: librecraft's open-source resourcepack!
Texturepack has 32x resolution by default, but accepts changing up to 128x!
Although 16x looks more appealing for some people,
it allows to create a distinct artistic style to get us further from
minecraft's copyright infringement.
