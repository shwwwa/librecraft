## What is librecraft

A project that tries to create a minecraft client (and server, secondary focus) implementation on top of the Bevy. Mainly made to showcase bevy's capabilities.
The project is in an **early stage**. Many features are not implemented, and maybe will never be implemented.
We welcome help from anyone willing to contribute!

## Design Goals

- **Fast**: App logic should run quickly, and when possible, in parallel
- **Modular**: To quickly implement changes between versions.
- **Compatible**: Compatible with minecraft servers and clients.
